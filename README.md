# Pattern Printing Programs in C

This repository contains daily practice problems related to pattern printing using C programming. 
Each program demonstrates various logic-building patterns like stars, numbers, alphabets, and more.

## Contents
- Star Patterns
- Number Patterns
- Hollow Patterns
- Triangle, Diamond, Pyramid patterns

## How to Use
Each `.c` file contains one pattern printing problem. You can:
- Download or clone the repo
- Compile using any C compiler like GCC
- Run the program and enter input

## Why This Repo?
This is part of my daily logic-building practice to improve C programming and problem-solving skills.
